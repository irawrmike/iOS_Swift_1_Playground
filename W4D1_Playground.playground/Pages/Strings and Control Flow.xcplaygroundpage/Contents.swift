 ## String Interpolation

 String interpolation is combining variables and constants inside a string.
 We can do this by writing the value in parentheses and write a backslash "`\`" before the parentheses.
 
 - Note:
 Formatting strings in Objective-C was usually done with the `stringWithFormat:` method.
 
 For example:
*/

var name = "Joe Smith"
print("Your name is \(name)")

/*:
 The sentence is printed as one string because string interpolation combined it for us.
 */
/*:
 - Experiment:
 Declare three variables about a person with their name, age and height. Then print out a sentence describing the person with the three variables.
 */
/*:
 - Example:
 "Your name is Joe Smith, your age is 35, and your height is 175cm."
 */
name = "Mike Stoltman"
var age = 29
var height = 185
print("My name is \(name), my age is \(age), and my height is roughly \(height)cm.")
/*:
 - Experiment:
 Math calculations can be included within the "`\()`" such as adding two variables together. Try printing out a sentence using string interpolation and include a calculation.
 */
print("the sum of 4 + 6 is: \(4+6).")

 ## Control Flow

 Use `'if'` and `'switch'` to make conditionals that run certain blocks of code. You've already seen this in Objective-C. The syntax is very similar except for the omission of the parenthesis around the condition.
 - Note:
 Swift switch statement supports pattern matching for different switch cases. You'll get to try them out with the example below.
*/

let myConditional = true
if myConditional {
    print("It's true!")
} else {
    print("It's false!")
}

/*:
 - Experiment:
  Try creating your own 'if' statement that determines whether a given number is even, odd or zero.
 */
var myNumber = 9
if myNumber == 0{
    print("\(myNumber) is 0!")
}else if myNumber % 2 == 0{
    print("\(myNumber) is even!")
}else if myNumber != 0{
    print("\(myNumber) is odd!")
}

/*:
 - Experiment:
 The following switch statement showcases multiple conditions to check. Some of the case conditions may be unfamiliar to you.
 Try changing the 'vegetable' variable to test the conditions and figure out how they work.
 */

let vegetable = "red pepper"
var vegetableComment = ""
switch vegetable {
case "celery":
    vegetableComment = "Add some raisins and make ants on a log."
case "cucumber", "watercress":
    vegetableComment = "That would make a good tea sandwich."
case let x where x.hasSuffix("pepper"):
    vegetableComment = "Is it a spicy \(x)?"
default:
    vegetableComment = "Everything tastes good in soup."
}
